# Project Overview

  

## Description

This app is a mock up of an informational app that could be used by individuals to learn about microbreweries in the State of Missouri. The app utilizes core data and app storage to allow users to add breweries to their interested list. The app itself utilizes combine to pull brewery information from the Open Brewery DB database via API. Brewery information is persisted between restarts of the app. 

The app allows the user this functionality regarding breweries:


- The API pulls brewery information for all breweries in the state of Missouri.
-  The app allows users to add breweries of interest to their own unique list. Brewery contact information as well as a link to their website is pulled via API.  Once a user adds a brewery to their list the information is stored in core data. 
- User list information is persisted between restarts of the app.
  

## Features

This app utilizes Combine to subscribe to the Open Brewery DB API that pulls all breweries in the state of Missouri. As new breweries are added to the database users will be able to learn about them. 

Data is persisted through the use of Core Data and App Storage.

The app features MVVM Architecture.
